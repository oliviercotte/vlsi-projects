## Design and implementation of an 8-bit microprocessor
- Full implementation of an 8-bit stack-based microprocessor.
- Use VHDL to model, simulate and describe the microprocessor circuit.
- The processor is to a level of complexity comparable to those that can be found in the current 8-bit microcontrollers.
- Create a test bench for all functionality of each modules.
- Ready to be synthesize for placement and routing step.
